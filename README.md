##### Code Details

The application is made using Python's Flask framework, which is a backend web framework. Using flask, python functions for all views or routes are written. A view or a route is something that a user can see / visit. For example one route is called "/" which is the homepage. Another one is "/signup" which can be visited to sign up for a new account. These python functions "listen" for HTTP requests from the front end and respond in different ways. The functions for routes of this application are written in [app.py](app.py), which is explained below:

###### app.py

At the start, required libraries/functions/modules are imported. Next Flask is configured and the database is connected, followed by functions for routes.

**index** (For "/" route)
